Create a function that takes in a String[] and deletes a random String from the Array and 
replace the missing space with the objects proceeding the removed object. It will then return 
the array. If the last object is removed, no other object will be moved. 
For example:
arr = {"hi","there","fred","pothead","gud"}
S.O.P.(ArrRandRemove(arr)) -> pothead
arr = {"hi","there","fred","gud", }


public static String ArrRandRemove(String[] arr){
	//code goes here
}
